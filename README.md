# sbt-ethereum-seed

Template for projects based on [sbt-ethereum](https://github.com/swaldman/sbt-ethereum).

`src/main/ethabi/BasicToken.json` and `src/main/solidity/SampleContract.sol` are merely examples, 
and you should replace them with your own files.
Similarly, if you want to define unit tests, place them in `test/scala`.

See the [sbt-ethereum Gitbook](https://mslinn.gitbooks.io/sbt-ethereum/content/) for more information.
